## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Successfully connected to Hedgehogs' PostgreSQL database and learned basic PostgreSQL syntax & table-making. Created small bit of python code to be try server connection.

## This Week's Plan

> Create tables into database, properly setup indices (by time of specific financial data) for the columns. Aside, I plan to take a look at extra financial data if needed and webscraping. (Yahoo Financial Data.)
 

## Anything Blocking?

> We plan on pushing the data onto the servers, but we haven't decided how we want the schemas and indices set up for the columns of data.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
