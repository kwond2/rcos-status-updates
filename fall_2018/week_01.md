## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Finally finished setting up docker and for our hedgehogs docker image. Also, we (Brian and I) downloaded SimFin Financial Data and created a parser to parse all of the financial data to prepare to put into our PostgreSQL server.

## This Week's Plan

> Connect to the PostgreSQL server and learn a bit of basic PostgreSQL to properly input data into the server and organize into tables.
 

## Anything Blocking?

> Having no previous knowledge of databases/servers platforms like PostgreSQL makes it a bit tough to understand the use of it. The language seems relatively easy to pick up though.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
