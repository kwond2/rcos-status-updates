## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Fixed up incorrectly made columns, and then wrote a more efficient python program to parse data and insert data. So , I finished inserting all 'fundamentals' data into the PSQL database.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I am going to clean up deprecated and empty tables on the PSQL database & make sure all the current tables in the server follow consistent formats so we can easily query all the necessary data from multiple taples. Once all the data is checked, then I'll be starting to work on more of the web development and learning what the REST API is, so that we can start querying data from our website.
