## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Since a few tables (company info and End of Day Data) were still missing correctly attached UUIDs, I repopulated the tables with the unique values to be queried easier in the future, and worked with Kristofer during the bonus session to make sure our Django models were accessing the correct tables. Also tried to clean up our company information tables to be able to search by company name rather than the ticker, but was hard to find a consistent list of tickers to company name, so we thought of using a temporary solution to just have the top 500 companies (S&P 500 Index) for now. Tried & learned a bit of beautifulsoup webscraper and python's pkl system to scrape from wikipedia. Was not able to really check out REST material.

## This Week's Plan

> Clean up presentation + time, clean up & comment all py code to update/pull to the development branch.
 

## Anything Blocking?

> Finding or creating a comprehensive csv or data for company name linked with ticker. Future block is likely thinking about how to modify company name to do easy search functionality. (Maybe searching "Google" instead of "Alphabet Inc.", while still keeping functionality to check data by ticker.)
