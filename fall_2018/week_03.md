## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Created tables for "Fundamentals" financial information, which includes all the companies indicators for a certain time. Created a more efficient parser to take alter large amounts of data. Took a look into end of day csv data from Yahoo Finance.

## This Week's Plan

> Write up python code to insert all SimFin csv data into PostgreSQL tables. Start taking a look at writing a script to update EOD (end of day) financial data from (likely Yahoo Finance or some csv data that can be taken easily), instead of manually updating everyday.
 

## Anything Blocking?

> One python module seems to be missing in my library, even though I've installed + tried reinstalling.

## Notes

> N/A.
