## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Tried my best to go through the classes & methods to get a general sense of underlying framework for running B7 with dynamorio.

## This Week's Plan

> Implement a more efficient way to take in a specific set of characters moreso than just a specific range of ASCII values to be checked when
attempting to correct. i.e. configure to include to test line feed to be checked as a value.
 

## Anything Blocking?

> Similar from last week: It's very hard to understand some of the functions I am trying to modify and how specific files interact with others. Only knowing Rust basics is a big limiting factor.

## Notes

> N/A.
