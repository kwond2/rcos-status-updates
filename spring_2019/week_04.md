## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Attempted to modify lib.rs & generators.rs to be able to take in an easily subsettable range of values. Original plan was to hardcode the values, but not very convenient.

## This Week's Plan

> Work on modifying the current methods to take in some sort of vector or a slice of hex ascii values, and to try the inputs by iterating through the ascii values (in hexidecimal/increment). 
 

## Anything Blocking?

> N/A.

## Notes
