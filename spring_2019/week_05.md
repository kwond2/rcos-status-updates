## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Have been trying to implement a way to take in a slice of a vector of hex values representing ascii. Have been constantly getting compiler errors.

## This Week's Plan

> Work out the rustc compiler errors, and keep referring back to the docs. Considering to start fresh from master and try to reimplement, or moving onto another problem.
 

## Anything Blocking?

> Understanding Rust enough to get B7 to compile & build with the modified classes & methods has been stressful. Have been getting mentor help to try my best to work through it.

## Notes

> N/A.
