## Last Week's Accomplishments

>  Set up my workspace with B7, getting all dependencies cleared and getting git set up. Learned the high level idea of B7, and then basic inner works of what is currently set up and what it does.

## This Week's Plan

> Familiarize myself with the current B7 classes and their methods so that I can start working on minor fixes in the implementation. Keep reading docs & referring to them as needed.
 

## Anything Blocking?

> B7's Rust code seems to be a bit more advanced than my basic understanding, along with learning how parts of some B7 classes interact with others.

## Notes

> N/A.
