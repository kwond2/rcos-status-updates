## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Attempted to work through compiler errors for lib.rs and generators.rs, but haven't gotten much progress with different implementations. Moved B7 to use GitLab.

## This Week's Plan

> Instead of touching the implementation, will try something easier; Write up a test case for strlenx86 running dynamorio, in a similar fashion to the wyvern test.

## Anything Blocking?

> Currently working on the test for strlenx86; currently does not seem to be building correctly/test case fails. Will likely have to save changed code and then pull/fetch the build files from scratch.

## Notes

> N/A.
